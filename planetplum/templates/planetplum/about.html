<h2><b>Omaha Underground</b> is a platform to help connect the Omaha music community.</h2>   
<br><br>
<p>
    Algorithm and ad driven social media platforms aren't built for a local music scene.
    They don't make it easy to discover and connect with each other.
    Hopefully this will make it easier.
